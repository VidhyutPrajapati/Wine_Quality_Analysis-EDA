# Wine quality Analysis

## By Vidhyut Prajapati

# Introduction

This project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) from differnet wine testing analysis using Python, documented in a Jupyter Notebook. This Dataset rates different wines and their content and color with humorous other attributes.There are two different dataset are given for red wines and white wines. The project is builiding to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.


# Questions to analyze

- Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?
- Do sweeter wines receive better ratings?
- Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?
- Do sweeter wines receive higher ratings?


# Project Details
Fully assessing and cleaning the entire dataset would require exceptional effort so only a subset of its issues (eight quality issues and two tidiness issues at minimum) needed to be assessed and cleaned.

The tasks for this project were:

- Data wrangling, which consists of:
  - Gathering data
  - Assessing data
  - Cleaning data
  - Appending data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing our wrangled data
Reporting on
  - finding insights
  - our data wrangling efforts and
  - our data analyses and visualizations
